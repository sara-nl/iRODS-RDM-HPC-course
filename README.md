# Course material for iRODS in HPC environments



## Goal

Learning about the CLI tool icommands of iRODS and how to use it in High Performance Computing environments for data processing and keeping all your data FAIR.



## Content

- iRODS in HPC introduction: presentation about iRODS, components of iRODS and how to use it in HPC environments.
- Hands-on iRODS icommands: introduction to the icommands and using basic data handling functionality
- Hands-on iRODS data processing use case: how can you use the icommands to get data from iRODS to an HPC compute cluster, perform the data processing, put results back into iRODS and maintain provenance over all the steps.
